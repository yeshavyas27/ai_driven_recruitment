    "            # \"content\": f\"You are a recruiter/ hiring manager looking for the best fit for a job against a candidate resume. The non-negotiables to find the best match are same skills, years of experience required and context of experience that is relevant to job expectations and responsiblities.Calculate the similarity score (0 lowest-1highest) between 2 groups of sentences, one is candidate experience and other is job description. The similarity score should be calculated based on skills matched in the sentence both lexically and semantically. If the must have or mandatory skills or statements are satisfied or are matched then give a high score. Similarly if contect of experience aligns with expectations and responsibilities give a good score. Make sure the matches with high score satisfy the expected years of experience in job listing.If the candidate has no experience or has done work in completely different domain and no skills coincide then give a low score. Give a moderate score if some skills match.Only give the score as output to the query. Avoid being biased over formal education required, focus on skills and experience.Sentence 1: {my_experience} and Sentence 2: {aiml_engineer_intern}\"\n",
